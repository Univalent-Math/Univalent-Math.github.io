<h3 id="aim-and-scope">Aim and Scope</h3>

  <p>
    Homotopy Type Theory/Univalent Foundations (HoTT/UF) is a new
    type-theoretic foundation for mathematics based on novel
    connections between dependent type theory and homotopy
    theory. Recently there has been much interest in the constructive
    meaning of the univalence axiom, which has led to multiple new
    cubical proof assistants natively supporting univalence and higher
    inductive types. These proof assistants allow for the convenient
    formalization of abstract mathematics, especially synthetic
    homotopy theory, and also provide several features previously
    missing from many type-theoretic proof assistants, such as
    function extensionality and quotients.
  </p>

  <p>The goal of this session is to gather experts on HoTT/UF and its
    implementation to present recent results and discuss future
    directions, including but not limited to:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Implementation of proof assistants for univalent mathematics</li>
    <li>Cubical type theories and their metatheory</li>
    <li>Formalization of univalent mathematics</li>
  </ul>

<!--<h4>Carlo Angiuli or Anders M&ouml;rtberg &mdash; TBA</h4>-->

<h4>Jesper Cockx &mdash; Rewriting Type Theory</h4>

<p>Dependently typed languages such as Coq and Agda can statically
guarantee the correctness of our proofs and programs. To provide this
guarantee, they restrict users to certain schemes – such as strictly
positive datatypes, complete case analysis, and well-founded induction
– that are known to be safe. However, these restrictions limit the
expressivity of the language and can make programs and proofs hard to
write. In this talk I present Rewriting Type Theory (RTT), a
dependently typed language with user-defined higher-order rewrite
rules. These rewrite rules can be used to ease reasoning about
existing definitions, and to extend the language with new constructs
such as quotient types and exceptions. To ensure subject reduction in
the presence of rewrite rules, I present a general method to check
confluence based on Tait and Martin-Löf's triangle property of
parallel reduction. I have implemented rewrite rules as an extension
to Agda, and a formalization of the metatheoretic properties of RTT
using MetaCoq is currently work in progress.</p>

<h4>Kuen-Bang Hou (Favonia) &mdash;
Nullable Compositions</h4>

<p>Cubical type theory has come a long way to have univalent universes, higher
inductive types, computational semantics, and Quillen equivalence to the
standard homotopy theory. For it to be a foundation of practical tools, however,
we still need more efficient normalization, type-checking, unification, and so
on. One hot spot is compositions, the new gadget introduced in cubical type
theory to impose proper higher-dimensional structure (fibrancy) in types. As an
effort to eliminate compositions as much as possible, we have been considering
variants of cubical type theory where there are no irreducible compositions at
the zeroth dimension. I call these undesirable compositions as null
compositions. To remove them, we have to kill all nullable compositions. We have
found ways to implement this move in various cubical type theories, but a
general solution is still lacking. This talk is an overview of what is currently
known.</p>

<h4>Valery Isaev &mdash; TBA</h4>

<h4>Anja Petkovi&cacute; &mdash;
Andromeda 2 - your type theory &agrave; la carte</h4>

<p>Andromeda 2 is a proof assistant that supports user-definable type theories
by providing a metalanguage to operate with rules, judgements and derivations.
The framework enables the user to work with various type theories, such as
variants of Martin-Löf type theory, extensional type theory, and homotopy type
theory. To make Andromeda 2 usable we have recently designed and implemented an
extensible equality checking algorithm that supports user-defined computation
rules (β-rules) and extensionality rules (inter-derivable with η-rules). In this
talk I will present the basic features of Andromeda 2 and illustrate how to use
them on some standard examples. This is joint work with Andrej Bauer and Philipp
G. Haselwarter.</p>

<h4>Mitchell Riley &mdash;
A Type Theory for Parameterised Spectra</h4>

<p>In synthetic homotopy theory, homology and cohomology theories are defined
via the spectra that represent them. This works well for simple examples, but
manipulating spectra defined internally in type theory quickly becomes
cumbersome. In this talk we describe an extension of HoTT with axiomatic 'smash'
and 'hom' types, with the intent of making 'stable synthetic homotopy theory'
more tractable. Dependent types and linear types are combined in a novel way,
presenting an interesting challenge for proof assistants.</p>

<h4>Andrea Vezzosi &mdash;
Indexed Families in Cubical Agda</h4>

<p>Cubical Agda provides a proof assistant where Higher Inductive Types and
Voevodsky's univalence principle have a computational interpretation. A
distinguishing feature of Agda is dependent pattern matching for Indexed
Inductive Families, which frees the user from having to explicitly deal with
equalities of indexes. In Cubical Agda, however, transport for indexed families
introduces new canonical forms that are not handled by how pattern matching
definitions compute.  We will see how to extend the elaboration of pattern
matching clauses to account for these new canonical forms.</p>

<h4>Matthew Weaver &mdash;
A constructive model of directed univalence in bicubical sets</h4>

<p>Directed type theory is an analogue of homotopy type theory where types
represent categories, generalizing groupoids. A bisimplicial approach to
directed type theory, developed by Riehl and Shulman, is based on equipping each
type with both a notion of path and a separate notion of directed morphism. In
this setting, a directed analogue of the univalence axiom asserts that there is
a universe of covariant discrete fibrations whose directed morphisms correspond
to functions—a higher-categorical analogue of the category of sets and
functions. In this work, we give a constructive model of a directed type theory
with directed univalence in bicubical, rather than bisimplicial, sets. We
formalize much of this model using Agda as the internal language of a 1-topos,
following Orton and Pitts. First, building on the cubical techniques used to
give computational models of homotopy type theory, we show that there is a
universe of covariant discrete fibrations, with a partial directed univalence
principle asserting that functions are a retract of morphisms in this universe.
To complete this retraction into an equivalence, we refine the universe of
covariant fibrations using the constructive sheaf models by Coquand and Ruch. In
this talk, I’ll present our constructive model of directed univalence, and
discuss our ongoing efforts to implement a proof-assistant based on this type
theory. (Joint work with Dan Licata)</p>
